## How to Play

The objective of Set is to identify a "set" of three cards from 12 cards laid out on the table. Each card has four features, which can vary as follows:

- **Number**: One, two, or three symbols.
- **Symbol**: Diamond, squiggle, or oval.
- **Shading**: Solid, striped, or open.
- **Color**: Red, green, or purple.

A set consists of three cards in which each of the features, looked at one by one, are either all the same on each card or are all different on each card. Play follows the traditional Set card game rules as described on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)).
