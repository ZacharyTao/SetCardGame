# Set Card Game in Swift

This project is a Swift implementation of the classic Set card game, designed for iOS devices using SwiftUI. The game challenges players to identify sets of cards based on color, shape, number, and shading, offering a fun and educational experience that tests pattern recognition and logic skills.

## Features

- **Classic Set Game Rules**: Play follows the traditional Set card game rules as described on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)).
- **Single Player Mode**: Challenge yourself against the clock to see how quickly you can clear the board.

## How to Play

The objective of Set is to identify a "set" of three cards from 12 cards laid out on the table. Each card has four features, which can vary as follows:

- **Number**: One, two, or three symbols.
- **Symbol**: Diamond, squiggle, or oval.
- **Shading**: Solid, striped, or open.
- **Color**: Red, green, or purple.

A set consists of three cards in which each of the features, looked at one by one, are either all the same on each card or are all different on each card. Play follows the traditional Set card game rules as described on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)).
